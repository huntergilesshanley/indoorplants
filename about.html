            <h2>About<sup>&nbsp;Generated by AI</sup></h2>
            <p>I created this project in 2007 when I was first given an indoor plant by my mother. Since then, I haven't looked back. I wanted to bring some education about houseplants to the people.
<br><br>
                Up until 2008, I could see only 1-2 new houseplants come into my house every few months and more would die than live.
                <br>                 <br> 
                I started writing about how to care for and plant and keep houseplants healthy.
                <br><br>
                My mission is to share knowledge about houseplants and give these amazing, beautiful and unusual plants a voice.
                <br><br>
                Let's change the perception of houseplants from boring, unsightly "green things" to enjoyable plants that will help us live well and live longer.
                <br><br>
                As an instructor and writer, I hope that you will help me inspire you to grow and care for beautiful plants of all kinds.
